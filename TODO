☐ New client changes that need to be developed        
    ☐ Refactor existing code to work as corn and simplify the existing tests    
    ☐ 0 goose, 0 corn : cost £0.25 : no cargo to take
    ☐ 1 goose, 0 corn : cost £0.25 : take in this order : goose
    ☐ 0 goose, 1 corn : cost £0.25 : take in this order : corn
    ☐ 2 goose, 0 corn : cost £0.50 : take in this order : goose, goose
    ☐ 0 goose, 2 corn : cost £0.50 : take in this order : corn, corn
    ☐ 1 goose, 1 corn : cost £0.50 : take corn first
    ☐ 1 goose, 2 corn : Do not make trip, corn is at risk
    ☐ 2 goose, 1 corn : Do not make trip, corn is at risk
    ☐ if you have both items and more than one of either then don't make the trip
    ☐ They will probably add another layer after this which puts geese at risk if I'm guessing where this is going. 
☐ Nice to haves if there is time
    ☐ Use the https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/ to update components and theme
    ☐ Extract components into components folder moving logic out of the App infrastructure
    ☐ Break components up within components to extract and simplify logic
    ☐ Style the application better so it looks and feels more presentable/professional
